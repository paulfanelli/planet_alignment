README file for the Planet Alignment program.

How to get it:
    git clone git@github.com:paulfanelli/planet_alignment.git

        -- OR --

    git clone https://github.com/paulfanelli/planet_alignment.git


How to install it:
    cd to where you 'git cloned' it:
        cd /home/<USER>/python-devel/planet_alignment

    Run the python setup.py script:
        sudo python setup.py install

    This will put an executable in /usr/bin (or /usr/local/bin), and
    will put some configuration files in /etc/planet_alignment.


How to run it:

    planet_alignment --config /etc/planet_alignment/system.yaml \
                     --plugins /etc/planet_alignment/align1.py \
                     --time 0.1

        -- OR -- (use the shorter options...)

    planet_alignment -c /etc/planet_alignment/system.yaml \
                     -p /etc/planet_alignment/align1.py \
                     -t 0.1

    This should output:

    align1: planet-A, planet-B


Additional info:

    Both the align1.py and align2.py files are derived from the base plugin.
    The base plugin is located in the site-packages (for your python installation):

    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/planet_alignment-1.0.0-py2.7.egg/planet_alignment/plugins/base.py

    The align1.py file is derived from BasePlugin (in the base.py file) without any of the methods being overridden.
    It's just a convenience plugin file, to run the base-line, without having to load the plugin from the deep path.

    The align2.py file is also derived from BasePlugin, but changes the default value of the alignment delta value.
